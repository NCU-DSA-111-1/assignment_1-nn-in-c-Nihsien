# Using Neural Network to realize XOR

Neural network is a type of machine learning process, it teaches computers to process data like the human brain.

In this assignment, we use neural network to teach computers to learn XOR.



## Usage

1. Compile and run to start training.

```
$ make
$ ./bin/Assignment_1
```

2. After training, we will get weights and loss of the training data.   
3.Input N bits data to test for N>=2.
4.Press ctrl+c to exit.

```
...             
////////////////////             
Start to test data              
////////////////////           
Input:11            
Output:0

Input:11111          
Output:1

Input:^c
```
